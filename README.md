## About

Custom Portrait is a personal AI project that explores human–AI interaction through an embodied conversational agent. The system simulates a “living portrait” that can interact with users in natural language while maintaining a consistent personality and long-term memory.

Unlike traditional chatbots, Custom Portrait focuses on personality modeling, context management, and persistent memory to create the illusion of a character that feels alive inside a portrait frame. The project is designed with a modular architecture and serves as a portfolio-grade system demonstrating applied AI engineering and system design skills.
